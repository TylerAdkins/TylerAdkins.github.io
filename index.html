		<td><h3>The Georgia Bulldogs</h3><p> The Georgia Bulldogs is a collegiate football team established in 1892. The Bulldogs are part of the Football Bowl Subdivision of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. In 1942 and 1980 the Bulldogs won the national championship, making them the best team in the college football.</p>
		<p> The Bulldogs are currently in their 2016 season and have a record of 4-4. The Bulldogs are lead by freshman quarterback Jacob Eason, junior running back Nick Chubb and new head coach Kirby Smart. The Bulldogs had high expectations this year, however the many changes the team experienced proved to be a huge obstacle.</p>
		<p> In years to come the Bulldogs hope to put all their talent together and win a national championship. With young talent and more young recruits, including quarterback Jake Fromm, coming into the program, hopefully the Bulldogs are able to soon bring a national championship back to the city of Athens and honor their winning tradition.</p>
